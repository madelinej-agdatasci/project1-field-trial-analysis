## Project 1: Computational Analysis of a Corn Hybrid Variety Trial
This project showcases the statistical analysis of a multi-site, field-based variety trial involving several experimental corn hybrids. 

Specifically, these hybrids were planted in different environments to determine ideal combinations of corn hybrids and fungicide treatments.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is twofold:
  1. To develop and strengthen practical skills in R and Python that are relevant to data analysis and computational agronomy.
  2. To demonstrate such skills with real-world-emulated datasets and analyses that address current challenges in agricultural R&D.

## Sources of Data and Code  
All data is synthetic, being generated from code (R or Python) that was provided by a prompted and guided large language model (such as ChatGPT). 

Subsequent code will be created from prior coding experience, online tutorials and blogs, DataCamp courses, and official language documentation. 
Large language models will primarily be used to assist in troubleshooting errors.

## Methods
  1. (software / coding language)
  2. (packages)
  3. (methods of cleaning/wrangling)
  4. (types of analyses)
  5. (visualization libraries)
  6. etc.
